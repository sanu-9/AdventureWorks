# Adventure Works Bike Shop Project

In this project I used Power BI to visualise the sales and return data hypothetical bike shop, Adventure Works.

## Use Power BI desktop to:

1. Connect and transform the raw data
2. Build a relational data model
3. Create calculated column and measure with DAX
4. Design an interactive dashboard to visualize data

I created 4 Dashboards and 1 decomposition tree which are pretty much required depth knowledge of visualization skills.I am attaching screenshot of dashboards to share detail and finding.

## 1. Executive Dashboard - 
  I started with high level KPIs that the leadership team care about Revenue, Profit, Orders & Return Rate.Weekly Revenue trending chart here as well.Some really cool interactive element that Power BI offers like sliders to zoom in on specific time period, custom tool tip & even completely custom filter pane as well.
  
  I was able to include some drill through functionality after introducing the table with the top 10 product and the order, revenue, return rate linked to them. This indicate that you may examine more information about a single product by clicking on it to access a different dashboard(the product detail dashboard).
  
  Introduction of the filter at  top right corner allows user to filter through different years and continent. Here is the result of dashboard showing numbers for the year 2022 and Europe continent.

  ## 2.Map Dashboard - 
  Total orders per Country 


  ## 3.Product Detail Dashboard - 
  This dashboard shows more detail for perticular product.
     
  Also, there is adjusted price displayed using numeric parameters to compare weekly profit and adjusted profit.

  Lastly, I added different product metrics using field parameters to showcase the weekly trend of selected metric.

  ## Customer Detail Dashboard -
  Build a customer-level view to drill into performance at the individual customer level and breakdown different customer profiles  and segments.
  
  ## 5.Decomposition Tree: 
  I added decomposition tree using AI features available in Power Bi to show data (total orders) across different categories and subcategories.



  
  


  #### In this project I explore features like bookmark, drillthrough filters, parameters, tooltips and more.
