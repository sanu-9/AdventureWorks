# Adventure Works Bike Shop Project

In this project I used Power BI to visualise the sales and return data hypothetical bike shop, Adventure Works.

## Use Power BI desktop to:

1. Connect and transform the raw data
2. Build a relational data model
3. Create calculated column and measure with DAX
4. Design an interactive dashboard to visualize data

I created 4 Dashboards and 1 decomposition tree which are pretty much required depth knowledge of visualization skills.I am attaching screenshot of dashboards to share detail and finding.

## 1. Executive Dashboard - 
  I started with high level KPIs that the leadership team care about Revenue, Profit, Orders & Return Rate.Weekly Revenue trending chart here as well.Some really cool interactive element that Power BI offers like sliders to zoom in on specific time period, custom tool tip & even completely custom filter pane as well.
  
  I was able to include some drill through functionality after introducing the table with the top 10 product and the order, revenue, return rate linked to them. This indicate that you may examine more information about a single product by clicking on it to access a different dashboard(the product detail dashboard).
